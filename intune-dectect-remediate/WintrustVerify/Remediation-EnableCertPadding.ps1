<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Enables the EnableCertPaddingCheck registry value for WinTrust.

.DESCRIPTION
    This remediation script enforces that 'EnableCertPaddingCheck' is set to 1 (REG_DWORD)
    in both 64-bit and 32-bit registry paths under WinTrust.

    While this script does check for the presence of registry paths and forcibly sets
    values, it does not evaluate compliance. It assumes a detection script has already 
    determined the device is non-compliant and simply enforces the expected configuration.

    The script is idempotent â€” running it multiple times will not cause issues and will
    ensure the correct setting is always applied.

    If $triggerReboot is set to $true and the remediation is successful, the script will
    initiate a reboot with a 60-second delay to allow logging and cleanup.
